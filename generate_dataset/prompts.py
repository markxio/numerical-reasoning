Example:
7UP brands represented an estimated 3.9% of the total domestic soft drink market in 1993, down from 4.0% in 1992.

Task 1: Numerical Entity Extraction

Q: What was the 7UP brands market shrae in 1993?
A: 3.9%

Task 2: Contextual Numerical Reasoning plus multi-hop (maybe across sentences or sections)

Q1: Did 7UPâ€™s market share increase or decrease compared to the previous year?
A1: Decrease
Q2: By how much did the 7UP brands market share decrease?
A2: 0.1% (4.0% - 3.9%)

a) did the value increase or decrease
b) What is the value in the latest year? By how much did the value increase or decrease?

The sentence mentions a metric that decreased or increased from one year to the other year. 
a) Did the metric decrease or increase?
b) By how much did the metric decrease or increase? By how much did the metric change?

Do not generate a question to which the answer is about time, date or years. Instead focus on questions targeted at numeric values such as quantities, percent or money. Then go on, to answer the newly generated question. The answer must be a single numeric value, supplemented by its metric if it is not just a quantity.
